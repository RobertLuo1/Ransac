# RANSAC

- As everyone knows that RANSAC is kind of a famous algorithm in computer vision and it is also easy to be implemented.
- Here there are two different files in this repository. One is for using RANSAC to fit the line and the other is for using RANSAC to fit the plane. All the hyper parameters are being tuned but if you like you can just change them. Both the programs are manually implemented. So, forgive my not tidy coding style.
- What I provide is kind of reference. I believe that someone will make better interface of this algorithm but I hope my code can help.
